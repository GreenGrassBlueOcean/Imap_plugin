# Imap Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to retrieve email messages from a given mail server.

## Creating a connection

To create an IMAP connection using the Airflow UI you need to open the interface > Admin dropdown menu > click on 'connections' > create. The connection needs to be of the form:
* Conn Id: Your connection id
* Host: This is the IMAP server url
* Login: Your email address
* Password: Your email password, this may not be the same as your everyday email password depending on your mail server
